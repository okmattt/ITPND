  <h1> What I've learned </h1>

    <p> An important concept in programming is have technological empathy.
  This means having an understanding of how technologies (like the web) work.</p>
  <div>
    <h3> The World Wide  Web</h3>
      <p> The web consists (roughly) of the follwing</p>
      <b>Web Browser</b> This is how you interact with the web.  The browser makes
  requests to servers via the internet<br>
      <b>Internet</b> The connections between your computer and servers...I think<br>
      <b>HTTP</b> otherwise known is <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocal</em>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">this is how information moves between browsers and servers</p>
  <!--Line 19 is my attempt to indent a line...-->
      <b>Servers</b> Computers that are good at sitting in closets and storing
  information. Browsers communicate with servings using HTTP.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3> HTML </h3>
      <b>HTML</b> stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>.   HTML is  a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. <br>
  The tags provide tell the computer how to interpret the text.<br>
  The tag &lt;b> &lt;/> will make text <b>bold</b>.<br>
  Two types of tags are inline and block.  I don't fully understand the difference
  other than to say block tags create a box around text.
      <span>
        <b>Span</b> is an inline tag.
      </span>
      <div>
        <b>Div</b> is a block tag.
      </div>
      <p>
        You can see the difference above.  With &lt;span>, it just kept displaying
        text in line.  With &lt;div>, it created a whole new line, like a box.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google Chrome has a very cool <strong>Developer Tools</strong> feature
        that allows you to view a web pages source code.  It even lets you
        <em>change</em> the source code! In the tool you can see how a particular
        website was structured and the style by viewing both the HTML and CSS.
        This. Is. Awesome.

        A few final notes on HTML and CSS
        <ul>
          <li>HTML and CSS are both languages</li>
          <li>HTML controls the structure of a web page</li>
          <li>CSS controls the style of a web page</li>
          <li><strong>Everything</strong> is boxes</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  </div>
